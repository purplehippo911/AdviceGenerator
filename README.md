## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Rest Api's

### What I learned

I learnt about two new html elements which I've never used before. The `<picture>` and `<source>`-elemnents. And I also got to practice on using promises with api's.     


```html
<picture>
        <source
            class="desktop"
            media="(min-width: 601px)"
            srcset="images/pattern-divider-desktop.svg"
        />
        <source
            class="mobile"
            media="(max-width: 550px)"
            srcset="images/pattern-divider-mobile.svg"
        />
        <img
            class="hero__pattern-divider"
            src="images/pattern-divider-desktop.svg"
            alt="Icon divider"
        />
</picture>
```
```js
function fetchAdvice() {
   fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((response) => {
      const data = response.slip;
      const id = data.id;
      const advice = data.advice;

      adviceId.textContent = `#${id}`;
      adviceText.textContent = `${advice}`;
      console.log(id, advice);
    });
}

```

### Continued development

I will continue on learning more about js, so that I can become more comfortable using it. I'm currently learning asynchrounus js, and after that I'm thinking on starting with npm stuff.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html_images_picture.asp) - This helped me understand a bit more about how to use the `<picture>`-element in HTML.
